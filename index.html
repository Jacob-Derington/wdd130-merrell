        <p>My Book of Mormon Journey</p>
        <p>What do you know about the Book of Mormon? Have you read it? Better yet, have you studied it? By the end of 2023, I truly didn’t know what the Book of Mormon was and I had never studied it. I was born in a Church claiming to be of God, but I never took it seriously. Scripture, the Book of Mormon being included, was read in my family growing up, but I never desired to learn from it. I coasted through Sunday School and Seminary. My faith, being upheld by my family around me, fell after I moved out. Beginning in the Spring of 2024, I found myself in a dark place spiritually and decided to do something about it. I began to study the Book of Mormon, and little by little it has transformed me. I have gained a great appreciation for the Book of Mormon, and I believe if you decide to study it for yourself, you will become all the better for it.</p>
