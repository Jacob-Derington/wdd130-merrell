                <p>If you didn’t already know what The Book of Mormon was, here’s the TL;DR: It’s Another Testament of Jesus Christ. It is a record of God’s work among peoples called Nephites, Lamanites, and Jaredites. They all journeyed from the old world in the East, to the Americas in the West. The Nephites and Lamanites arrived as one family in about 600 B.C. and split almost immediately, becoming enemies. The Jaredites began their journey at the Tower of Babel when the Lord confused their languages and scattered its inhabitants. The main theme of The Book of Mormon is <strong>Repentance</strong>. Every time these peoples turned to The Lord Jesus Christ, they became a great and happy people, prospering in righteousness. Every time they turned away, they destroyed themselves, proving the utter destruction of the Nephites and Jaredites. As stated in its title page, The Universal Mission of The Book of Mormon is “to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations”. I am in my first true study of this Book, and from what I have found, this is a Book of Jesus Christ; full of The Principles of Pure Christianity.</p>
                
                <p>So far, I have read up to 3 Nephi 13.</p>

                <p>“And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.” – 2 Nephi 33:10</p>

                <p>“And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning—Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.” – Alma 37:3-4</p>
