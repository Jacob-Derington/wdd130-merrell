                <h2>Client Repot</h2>
                <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</p>
                <ul>
                    I had a idea of waht I wanted my page to look like and I only wanted one picture on it. As for the content i put down some random info for them to use and put on the page. 
                </ul>
                <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</p>
                <ul>Mostly through email. He didn’t show up to class on time.</ul>
                <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</p>
                <ul>Yes I saw the home page and I love how it looks.</ul>
                <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</p>
                <ul>I would keep most of it the same. i liked how they took what I gave them and made it fun.</ul>
