                <h2>Client Repot</h2>
                <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</p>
                <li>I had a idea of what I wanted my page to look like and I only wanted one picture on it. As for the content i put down some random info for them to use and put on the page. </li>
                <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</p>
                <li>Mostly through email. He didn’t show up to class on time.</li>
                <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</p>
                <li>Yes I saw the home page and I love how it looks.</li>
                <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</p>
                <li>I would keep most of it the same. i liked how they took what I gave them and made it fun.</li>

                <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
                <p>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</p>
                <li>I didn’t have the opertunity to. One had a brocken foot I think the other never reached out to me to find out what was going on and it was one big logistic nightmare.</li>
                <p>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</p>
                <li>Luckly he was there bacicly every day so I was able to talk to him and get more information.</li>
                <p>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</p>
                <li>I think I handled it well. As for sharing it I showed him my work often to get feedback.</li>
                <p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</p>
                <li>Slow. I would make a change and it would take forever to update the site. That made making changes hard and some what unpredictable. Anothier thing taht was hard was not understanding if I set up the page corectly.</li>

                <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
                <p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</p>
                <li>Mostly through email or waiting.the biggest problum I feel was that we were working on 3 websites all at the same time and that didnt give much time to talk with eachother.</li>
                <p>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</p>
                <li>I think I focused on making my part of the website and if it looks right and is presentable then I did good.</li>
                <p>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</p>
                <li>Yes, and I finised my pages.</li>
                <p>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</p>
                <li>No, it was just super slow.</li>
